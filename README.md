# Hardware-Inventory

Being in professional IT organization, it is very important to keep track of all these devices.
Managing this information in a presentable and updatable read-only manner is the purpose of this project.
This purpose would solve the problem of not being able to know about the basic yet informative data of devices such as
Device type, Device ID, Device OS, Device IP, Device Model, Manufacturer etc.,
additional problems such as not knowing whether a device is connected to network, 
being able to know about certain machine without physically trying to go the device are some of the problems that will be solved.


Used .  NET Webforms, Bootstrap libraries; Javascript and some AJAX for printer scan on Front end.
